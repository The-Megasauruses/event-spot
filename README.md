## Our Team

Raymond Ruazol - Lacey Washington - Rhett Beardemphl

What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

- Raymond's key strengths come from his experience in the field & navigating group environments.
- Lacey's key strengths are finding creative ways to find information needed to solve complex problems.
- Rhett's key strengths are connecting user's from the front-end and manipulating database information.

How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

All of our strengths center on teamwork and problem solving. Many minds tackling a conflict will allow us to arise to a solution sooner.

In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

- Raymond would like to develop his mission and vision alignment.
- Lacey would like to get better at handling ambiguity and keeping his cool when dealing with vague situations.
- Rhett would like to farther his leadership skills.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

At the start of each "get together" we will have a group meeting where we discuss what we will be working on each day and review any problems we might be encountering.

## Conflict Plan

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Fight to the death in Apex Legends. And if that doesn't work... at the start of each "get together" we will make space for people to voice their issues and since we have an uneven number of members we can easily put any conflicts to a vote.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

We will present the idea at our team meeting and discuss options to stop this acivity from continuing.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Constant communication and our mantra "not everyone can write all of the code but everyone has the right to know all of the code."

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? If your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

After one group meeting or slack convo about the inadequate contribution we will get our instructor involved.

Our project management tool and all of our files.

How will you share the repository with your teammates?

We will be in a GitHub Organization.

What is your Git flow?

We will all have our own development branches and we will push them from there into a feature/dev branch which will lead to our main branch.

How many people must review a PR?

Yes, from dev to main we will make GitHub require an extra person to approve the PR.

Who merges PRs?

The person who wrote the code and one other group memeber.

How often will you merge?

From our individual branches to main we would merge as we see fit but we would only merge to main when we complete a new feature.
